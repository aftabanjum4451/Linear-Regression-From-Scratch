## Project Highlight
- Load the data  
- Data Cleaning
- Model Design
  - Intilized the weights and biase vector
  - Model function
  - Loss function
  - Compute gradients
  - Adjust weights and biases to reduce the loss
  - Train the model using gradient descent
- Evaluate the Model performance base on RMSE

## Model
- **Designed the Linear Regression From scratch**
- **Pythorch Bulid in Linear Regression**
